# Issue tracker: GitHub

Issues and specs live in GitHub Issues for `theozex4ever/snake_survivor`. Use the `gh` CLI.

- Create: `gh issue create --title "..." --body-file <file>`
- Read: `gh issue view <number> --comments`
- List: `gh issue list --state open --json number,title,body,labels,comments`
- Comment: `gh issue comment <number> --body-file <file>`
- Label: `gh issue edit <number> --add-label "..."` or `--remove-label "..."`
- Close: `gh issue close <number> --comment "..."`

Run inside this clone so gh resolves the repository. Use body files for multiline text.
